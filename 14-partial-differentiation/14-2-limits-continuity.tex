\section{Limits and Continuity}\label{sec:LimitsContinuityPartialDifferentiation}

To develop calculus for functions of one variable, we needed to make
sense of the concept of a limit, which was used in the definition of a
continuous function and the derivative of a function. Limits involving
functions of two variables can be considerably more difficult to deal
with; fortunately, most of the functions we encounter are fairly easy
to understand.

The potential difficulty is largely due to the fact that there are
many ways to ``approach'' a point in the $x$-$y$ plane. If we want to
say that $\ds\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f(x,y)=L$, we need to capture the
idea that as $(x,y)$ gets close to $(a,b)$ then $f(x,y)$ gets close to
$L$. For functions of one variable, $f(x)$, there are only two ways
that $x$ can approach $a$: from the left or right. But there are an
infinite number of ways to approach $(a,b)$: along any one of an
infinite number of straight lines, or even along a curved path in the $x,y$-plane. We might hope that it's
really not so bad---suppose, for example, that along every possible
line through $(a,b)$ the value of $f(x,y)$ gets close to $L$; surely
this means that ``$f(x,y)$ approaches $L$ as $(x,y)$ approaches
$(a,b)$''. Sadly, no.

\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Weird Limit}{weird limit}
Analyze $f(x,y)=xy^2/(x^2+y^4)$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
When $x=0$ or $y=0$, $f(x,y)$ is 0, so the limit of $f(x,y)$ approaching the
origin along either the $x$ or $y$ axis is 0. Moreover, along the line
$y=mx$, $f(x,y)=m^2x^3/(x^2+m^4x^4)$. As $x$ approaches 0 this expression
approaches 0 as well. So along every line through the origin $f(x,y)$
approaches 0. Now suppose we approach the origin along $x=y^2$. Then 
$$f(x,y)={y^2y^2\over y^4+y^4}={y^4\over2y^4}={1\over2},$$
so the limit is $1/2$. Looking at Figure~\ref{fig:weird limit}, it
is apparent that there is a ridge above $x=y^2$. Approaching the
origin along a straight line, we go over the ridge and then drop down
toward 0, but approaching along the ridge the height is a constant
$1/2$. 
\end{solution}

Fortunately, we can define the concept of limit without needing to
specify how a particular point is approached---indeed, in 
Definition~\ref{def:limitprecise}, we didn't need the concept of
``approach.'' Roughly, that definition says that when $x$ is 
close to $a$ then $f(x)$ is close to $L$; there is no mention of
``how'' we get close to $a$. We can adapt that definition to two
variables quite easily:

\begin{definition}{Limit of a Multivariate Function}{limit}
Suppose $f(x,y)$ is a function. We say that 
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to
  (a,b)}f(x,y)=L$$
 if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ so that
  whenever $0 < \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} < \delta$, $|f(x,y)-L|<\epsilon$.\index{limit!multivariate function}
\end{definition}

This says that we can make $|f(x,y)-L|<\epsilon$, no matter how small
$\epsilon$ is, by making the distance from $(x,y)$ to $(a,b)$ ``small
enough''. 

\begin{example}{Multivariate Limit}{multilimitone}
Show that $\ds \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}{3x^2y\over
	x^2+y^2}=0$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
Suppose $\epsilon>0$. Then
$$\left|{3x^2y\over x^2+y^2}\right|={x^2\over x^2+y^2}3|y|.$$
Note that $x^2/(x^2+y^2)\le1$ and
$|y|=\sqrt{y^2}\le\sqrt{x^2+y^2}<\delta$. So
$${x^2\over x^2+y^2}3|y|<1\cdot 3\cdot \delta.$$
We want to force this to be less than $\epsilon$ by picking $\delta$
``small enough.'' If we choose $\delta=\epsilon/3$ then
$$\left|{3x^2y\over x^2+y^2}\right|< 1\cdot 3\cdot{\epsilon\over3}=
\epsilon.$$
\end{solution}

Recall that a function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=a$ if 
$\ds\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$. We can say exactly the same thing about
a function of two variables: $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(a,b)$ if 
$\ds\lim_{(x,y)\to (a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)$.

The function $f(x,y)=3x^2y/(x^2+y^2)$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$,
because $f(0,0)$ is not defined. However, we know that 
$\ds \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=0$, so we can make a continuous function,
by extending the definition of $f$ so that $f(0,0)=0$.
This surface is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:removable discontinuity}.

\endpicture}}
%\endtexonly
\caption{$\ds f(x,y)={3x^2y\over x^2+y^2}$}
\label{fig:removable discontinuity}
\end{figure}

Note that we cannot extend the definition of the function in Example~\ref{exa:weird limit}
to create a continuous function, since the limit does not exist as we approach $(0,0)$.

Fortunately, the functions we will be working with will usually be
continuous almost everywhere.
As with single variable functions, two classes of common functions are
particularly useful and easy to describe. A
polynomial\index{polynomial!of two variables} in two
variables is a sum of terms of the form $ax^my^n$, where $a$ is a real
number and $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers. A rational
function\index{function!of two variables}
is a quotient of polynomials.

\begin{theorem}{Continuity of Functions}{ContFunctTheorem}
Polynomials are continuous everywhere. Rational functions are
continuous everywhere they are defined.
\end{theorem}
