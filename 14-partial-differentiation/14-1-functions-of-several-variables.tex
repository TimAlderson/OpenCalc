\section{Functions of Several Variables}\label{sec:FunctionsSeveralVariables}

In single-variable calculus we were concerned with functions that map
the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, sometimes called ``real functions of
one variable'', meaning the ``input'' is a single real number and the
``output'' is likewise a single real number. Now we turn to functions of several
variables, where several input variables are mapped to one value: functions
$f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$. We will deal primarily with $n=2$ and to a lesser
extent $n=3$; in fact many of the techniques we discuss can be applied
to larger values of $n$ as well.

A function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ maps a pair of values $(x,y)$ to a
single real number. The three-dimensional coordinate system we have
already used is a convenient way to visualize such functions: above
each point $(x,y)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane we graph the point $(x,y,z)$,
where of course $z=f(x,y)$. 

\begin{example}{Plane}{PlaneFunction}
Describe the function $f(x,y)=3x+4y-5$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
Writing this as 
$z=3x+4y-5$ and then $3x+4y-z=5$ we recognize the equation of a
plane. In the form $f(x,y)=3x+4y-5$ the emphasis has shifted: we now
think of $x$ and $y$ as independent variables and $z$ as a variable
dependent on them, but the geometry is unchanged.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Sphere}{SphereEquation}
Describe the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
We have seen that $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$ represents a sphere of radius
2. We cannot write this in the form $f(x,y)$, since for
each $x$ and $y$ in the disk $x^2+y^2<4$ there are two corresponding
points on the sphere. As with the equation of a circle, we can resolve
this equation into two functions, $\ds f_1(x,y)=\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}$ and 
$\ds f_2(x,y)=-\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}$, representing the upper and lower
hemispheres, respectively. Each of these is an example of a function with a
restricted domain: only certain values of $x$ and $y$ make sense
(namely, those for which $x^2+y^2\le 4$) and the graphs of these
functions are limited to a small region of the plane.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Square Root}{MultivariateSquareRootFunction}
Describe the function $f(x,y)=\sqrt x+\sqrt y$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
This function is defined only when
both $x$ and $y$ are non-negative. When $y=0$ we get $f(x,y)=\sqrt x$,
the familiar square root function in the $x$-$z$ plane, and when $x=0$
we get the same curve in the $y$-$z$ plane. Generally speaking, we see
that starting from $f(0,0)=0$ this function gets larger in every direction
in roughly the same way that the square root function gets
larger. For example, if we restrict attention to the line $x=y$, we
get $f(x,y)=2\sqrt x$ and along the line $y=2x$ we have $f(x,y)=\sqrt
x+\sqrt{2x}=(1+\sqrt2)\sqrt x$.
\end{solution}

\end{figure}

A computer program that plots such surfaces can be very useful, as it
is often difficult to get a good idea of what they look like. Still,
it is valuable to be able to visualize relatively simple surfaces
without such aids. As in the previous example, it is often a good idea
to examine the function on restricted subsets of the plane, especially
lines. It can also be useful to identify those points $(x,y)$ that
share a common $z$-value.

\begin{example}{Elliptic Paraboloid}{EllipticParaboloidFunction}
Describe the graph of $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
When $x=0$ this becomes
$f=y^2$, a parabola in the $y$-$z$ plane; when $y=0$ we get the
``same'' parabola $f=x^2$ in the $x$-$z$ plane. 

Finally, picking a value $z=k$, at what points does
$f(x,y)=k$? This means $x^2+y^2=k$, which we recognize as the equation
of a circle of radius $\sqrt k$. So the graph of $f(x,y)$ has
parabolic cross-sections, and the same height everywhere on concentric
circles with center at the origin. This fits with what we have already
discovered. 
\end{solution}

%\endtexonly
\caption{$f(x,y)=x^2 + y^2$}
\label{fig:parabolic bowl}
\end{figure}

As in this example, the points $(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y)=k$ usually
form a curve, called a \dfont{level curve} of the
function. A graph of some level curves can give a good idea of the
shape of the surface; it looks much like a topographic map of the
surface. In Figure~\ref{fig:parabolic bowl} both the surface and
its associated level curves are shown. Note that, as with a
topographic map, the heights corresponding to the level curves are
evenly spaced, so that where curves are closer together the surface is
steeper.

Functions $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ behave much like functions of two
variables; we will on occasion discuss functions of three variables.
The principal difficulty with such functions is visualizing them, as
they do not ``fit'' in the three dimensions we are familiar with. For
three variables there are various ways to interpret functions that
make them easier to understand. For example, $f(x,y,z)$ could
represent the temperature at the point $(x,y,z)$, or the pressure, or
the strength of a magnetic field.  It remains useful to consider those
points at which $f(x,y,z)=k$, where $k$ is some constant value. If
$f(x,y,z)$ is temperature, the set of points $(x,y,z)$ such that
$f(x,y,z)=k$ is the collection of points in space with temperature $k$;
in general this is called a \dfont{level set}; for
three variables, a level set is typically a surface, called a \dfont{level surface}.

\begin{example}{Level Surfaces}{LevelSurfacesExample}
Suppose the temperature at $(x,y,z)$ is 
$T(x,y,z)=e^{-(x^2+y^2+z^2)}$. This function has a maximum value of 1
at the origin, and tends to 0 in all directions. If $k$ is positive
and at most 1,
the set of points for which $T(x,y,z)=k$ is those points satisfying
$x^2+y^2+z^2=-\ln k$, a sphere centered at the origin. The level
surfaces are the concentric spheres centered at the origin.
\end{example}
