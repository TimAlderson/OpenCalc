%In what follows, we use the notation $(x_1,y_1)$ to represent a point in
%the $(x,y)$ coordinate system, also called the $(x,y)$-plane.
%Previously, we used $(a,b)$ to represent
%an open interval. Notation often gets reused and abused in mathematics, 
%but thankfully, it is usually clear from the context what we mean.
%
%In the $(x,y)$ coordinate system we normally write the $x$-axis
%horizontally, with positive numbers to the right of the origin, and
%the $y$-axis vertically, with positive numbers above the origin.  That
%is, unless stated otherwise, we take ``rightward'' to be the positive
%$x$-direction and ``upward'' to be the positive $y$-direction.  In a
%purely mathematical situation, we normally choose the same scale for
%the $x$- and $y$-axes.  For example, the line joining the origin to
%the point $(a,a)$ makes an angle of 45${}^\circ$ with the $x$-axis
%(and also with the $y$-axis).
%
%In applications, often letters other than $x$ and $y$ are used, and
%often different scales are chosen in the horizontal and vertical
%directions.  \\

%\begin{example}{Data Plot}{DataPlot}
%Suppose you drop a coin from a window, and you want to study how 
%its height above the ground changes from second to second.
%It is natural to let the letter $t$ denote the time
%(the number of seconds since the object was released) and to let the
%letter $h$ denote the height.  For each $t$ (say, at one-second
%intervals) you have a corresponding height $h$.  This information can
%be tabulated, and then plotted on the $(t,h)$ coordinate plane, as
%shown in figure~\ref{fig:data plot}.

%We use the word ``quadrant'' for each of the four regions into which

%have both coordinates positive, or the ``northeast'' portion of the

%counterclockwise, so the second quadrant is the northwest, the third
%is the southwest, and the fourth is the southeast.
%
%Suppose we have two points $A$ and $B$ in the $(x,y)$-plane.
%We often want to know the change in $x$-coordinate (also called the
%``horizontal distance'') in going from $A$ to $B$.  This is often
%written $\Delta x$, where the meaning of $\Delta$ (a capital delta in
%the Greek alphabet) is ``change in''. Thus, $\Delta x$ can be read as
%``change in $x$'' although it usually is read as ``delta $x$''. The
%point is that $\Delta x$ denotes a single number, and should not be
%interpreted as ``delta times $x$''. Similarly, the ``change in $y$'' is written $\Delta y$
%and represents the difference between the $y$-coordinates of the 
%two points. It is the vertical distance you have to move in going from $A$ to $B$. \\
%
%\begin{example}{Change in $x$ and $y$}{ChangeIn}\label{ChangeIn}
%If $A=(2,1)$ and $B=(3,3)$ the change in $x$ is
%$$\Delta x=3-2=1$$
%while the change in $y$ is
%$$\Delta y= 3-1=2.$$
%\vspace{-0.5cm}
%\end{example}
%
%The general formulas for the change in $x$ and the change in $y$ 
%between a point $(x_1,y_1)$ and a point $(x_2,y_2)$ are:
%$$
%\Delta x=x_2-x_1,\qquad\qquad\Delta y=y_2-y_1.
%$$
%Note that either or both of these might be negative.

\subsection{Lines}\label{sec:lines}
If we have two \ifont{distinct} points $A(x_1,y_1)$ and $B(x_2,y_2)$, then we can draw one
and only one straight line through both points.  By the \dfont{slope} of this line
we mean the ratio of $\Delta y$ to $\Delta x$.  The slope is often denoted by the letter $m$. \\

\begin{formulabox}[Slope Formula]
The slope of the line joining the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is:
$$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}$$
\end{formulabox}

\bigskip

\begin{example}{Slope of a Line Joining Two Points}{SlopeofLine}
The line joining the two points $(1,-2)$ and $(3,5)$ has slope
$\ds m=\frac{5-(-2)}{3-1}=\frac{7}{2}$
%\vspace{-0.8cm}
\end{example}

The most familiar form of the equation of a straight line is:
$$y=mx+b.$$
Here $m$ is the slope of the line: if you increase $x$ by
1, the equation tells you that you have to increase $y$ by $m$; and if
you increase $x$ by $\Delta x$, then $y$ increases by $\Delta
y=m\Delta x$.  The number $b$ is called the \dfont{y-intercept}, because
it is where the line crosses the $y$-axis (when $x=0$).  If you know two points on
a line, the formula $m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$ gives you the slope.
Once you know a point and the slope, then the $y$-intercept can be
found by substituting the coordinates of either point in the equation:
$y_1=mx_1+b$, i.e., $b=y_1-mx_1$.  Alternatively, one can use the
\dfont{``point-slope'' form} of the equation of a straight line: start with
$(y-y_1)/(x-x_1)=m$ and then multiply to get 
$$(y-y_1)=m(x-x_1),$$ the
point-slope form. Of course, this may be further manipulated to get
$y=mx-mx_1+y_1$, which is essentially the \dfont{``$y=mx+b$'' form}.

It is possible to find the equation of a line between two points directly
from the relation $m=(y-y_1)/(x-x_1)=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)$, which says ``the
slope measured between the point $(x_1,y_1)$ and the point $(x_2,y_2)$ is
the same as the slope measured between the point $(x_1,y_1)$ and any other
point $(x,y)$ on the line.''  For example, if we want to find the equation
of the line joining points $A(2,1)$ and $B(3,3)$, we can use
this formula:
$$
m=\frac{y-1}{x-2}=\frac{3-1}{3-2}=2,\qquad\hbox{so~that}\qquad
y-1=2(x-2),\qquad\hbox{i.e.,}\qquad y=2x-3.
$$
Of course, this is really just the point-slope formula, except that we
are not computing $m$ in a separate step. 
We summarize the three common forms of writing a straight line below:\\

\begin{formulabox}[Slope-Intercept Form of a Straight Line]
An equation of a line with slope $m$ and $y\, $-intercept $b$ is:
$$y=mx+b.$$
\end{formulabox}

\bigskip

\begin{formulabox}[Point-Slope Form of a Straight Line]
An equation of a line passing through $(x_1,y_1)$ and having slope $m$ is:
$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1).$$
\end{formulabox}

\bigskip

\begin{formulabox}[General Form (Standard Form) of a Straight Line]
Any line can be written in the form
$$Ax+By+C=0,$$
where $A,B,C$ are constants and $A,B$ are not both $0$.
\end{formulabox}

The slope $m$ of a line in the form $y=mx+b$ tells us the
direction in which the line is pointing.  If $m$ is positive, the line goes
into the 1st quadrant as you go from left to right.   If $m$ is large and
positive, it has a steep incline, while if $m$ is small and positive, 
then the line has a small angle of inclination.  If $m$ is negative, the
line goes into the 4th quadrant as you go from left to right.  If $m$ is
a large negative number (large in absolute value), then the line points
steeply downward. If $m$ is negative but small in absolute value, then it points
only a little downward.

If $m=0$, then the line is horizontal and its equation is simply $y=b$.

All of these possibilities are illustrated below.

There is one type of line that cannot be written in the form $y=mx+b$,
namely, vertical lines.  A vertical line has an equation of the form $x=a$.
Sometimes one says that a vertical line has an ``infinite'' slope.

It is often useful to find the $x$-intercept of a line $y=mx+b$.  This is
the $x$-value when $y=0$.  Setting $mx+b$ equal to 0 and solving for
$x$ gives: $x=-b/m$.  \\

\begin{example}{Finding $x$-intercepts}{xintercepts}
To find $x$-intercept of the line $y=2x-3$, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$:
$$0 = 2x-3\qquad\to\qquad x = \frac{3}{2}.$$
Thus, the line has an $x$-intercept of $3/2$.
\end{example}

It is often necessary to know if two lines are parallel or perpendicular.
Let $m_1$ and $m_2$ be the slopes of the nonvertical lines $L_1$ and $L_2$.
Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $L_1$ and $L_2$ are \dfont{parallel} if and only if $m_1=m_2$.
\item $L_1$ and $L_2$ are \dfont{perpendicular} if and only if $\ds{m_2=\frac{-1}{m_1}}$.
\end{itemize}
In the case of perpendicular lines, we say their slopes are \ifont{negative reciprocals}. 
Below is a visual representation of a pair of parallel lines and a pair of perpendicular lines.
$$\includegraphics[width=3.7in]{images/lines-1}$$

\begin{example}{Equation of a Line}{EquationLine}
For each part below, find an equation of a line satisfying the requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Through the two points $(0,3)$ and $(-2,4)$.
\item[(b)] With slope $7$ and through point $(1,-2)$.
\item[(c)] With slope $2$ and $y$-intercept $4$.
\item[(d)] With $x$-intercept $8$ and $y$-intercept $-3$.
\item[(e)] Through point $(5,3)$ and parallel to the line $2x+4y+2=0$.
\item[(f)] With $y$-intercept $4$ and perpendicular to the line $\ds{y=-\frac{2}{3}x+3}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
\noindent(a) We use the \ifont{slope formula} on $(x_1,y_1)=(0,3)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(-2,4)$ to find m:
$$m=\frac{(4)-(3)}{(-2)-(0)}=\frac{1}{-2}=-\frac{1}{2}.$$
Now using the \ifont{point-slope formula} we get an equation to be:
$$y-3=-\frac{1}{2}\left(x-0\right)\quad\to\quad y=-\frac{1}{2}x+3.$$

\noindent(b) Using the \ifont{point-slope formula} with $m=7$ and $(x_1,y_1)=(1,-2)$ gives:
$$y-(-2)=7(x-1)\quad\to\quad y = 7x-9.$$

\noindent(c) Using the \ifont{slope-intercept formula} with $m=2$ and $b=4$ we get $y=2x+4$.

\noindent(d) Note that the intercepts give us two points: $(x_1,y_1)=(8,0)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(0,-3)$.
Now follow the steps in part (a):
$$m=\frac{-3-0}{0-8}=\frac{3}{8}$$
Using the \ifont{point-slope formula} we get an equation to be:
$$y-(-3)=\frac{3}{8}\left(x-0\right)\quad\to\quad y=\frac{3}{8}x-3$$

\noindent(e)  The line $2x+4y+2=0$ can be written as:
$$4y = -2x - 2 \quad\to\quad y=-\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{2}$$
This line has slope $-1/2$.
Since our line is \ifont{parallel} to it, we have $m=-1/2$.
Now we have a point $(x_1,y_1)=(5,3)$ and slope $m=-1/2$, thus, the \ifont{point-slope formula} gives:
$$y-3=-\frac{1}{2}\left(x-5\right).$$

\noindent(f) The line $\ds{y=-\frac{2}{3}x+3}$ has slope $m=-2/3$.
Since our line is perpendicular to it, the slope of our line is the \ifont{negative reciprocal}, hence, $m=3/2$.
Now we have $b=4$ and $m=3/2$, thus by the \ifont{slope-intercept formula}, an equation of the line is
$$y=\frac{3}{2}x+4.$$
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\end{solution}


\begin{example}{Parallel and Perpendicular Lines}{ParallelPerpendicularLines}
Are the two lines $7x+2y+3=0$ and $6x-4y+2=0$ perpendicular? Are they parallel? If they are not parallel, what is their point of intersection?
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
The first line $L_{1}$ re-expressed in slope-intercept form is:
$$7x+2y+3=0\quad\to\quad 2y=-7x-3\quad\to\quad y=-\frac{7}{2}x-\frac{3}{2}.$$
It has slope $m_1=-7/2$.
The second line $L_{2}$ in slope-intercept form is:
$$6x-4y+2=0\quad\to\quad -4y=-6x-2\quad\to\quad y=\frac{3}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}.$$
It has slope $m_2=3/2$. Since $m_1\neq m_2$ the lines are not parallel. The lines are also not perpendicular since $m_1\cdot m_2\neq -1$ (they are not negative reciprocals). Therefore, the lines must intersect.\\
We find points of intersection by setting the $y$ -values of $L_{1} = L_{2}$, and then solve for $x$.

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
	In particular, we have
	
	$$\begin{array}{rcl}
	L_{1} & = & L_{2} \\
	\ds{-\frac{7}{2}x-\frac{3}{2}} & = & \ds{\frac{3}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}} \\
	\end{array} $$
	
Solving for $x$ gives $x=-2/5$. \\

Then substituting this 
into either $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$ \\
gives $y=-1/10$.\\
 
Therefore, the lines intersect at the point $(-2/5,-1/10)$.
