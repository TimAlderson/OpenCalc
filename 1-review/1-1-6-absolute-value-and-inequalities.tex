\subsection{Solving Inequalities that Contain Absolute Values}
We start by solving an equality that contains an absolute value.
To do so, we recall that if $a\geq 0$ then the solution to 
$|x|=a$ is $x=\pm a$. In cases where we are not sure if the right 
side is positive or negative, we must perform a check at the end. \\

\begin{example}{Absolute Value Equality}{AbsoluteValueEquality}
Solve for $x$ in $|2x+3|=2-x$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
This means that either:
\[\begin{array}{ccc}
	2x+3=+(2-x) & \mbox{\ifont{or}} & 2x+3=-(2-x)\\
	2x+3=2-x & \mbox{\ifont{or}} & 2x+3=-2+x\\
	3x=-1 & \mbox{\ifont{or}} & x=-5\\
	x=-1/3 & \mbox{\ifont{or}} & x=-5\\
\end{array}\]
Since we do not know if the right side $``a=2-x"$ is positive or negative, we must perform a check of our answers omit any that are incorrect.

If $x=-1/3$, then we have $LS=|2(-1/3)+3|=|-2/3+3|=|7/3|=7/3$ and $RS=2-(-1/3)=7/3$.
In this case $LS=RS$, so $x=-1/3$ is a solution.

If $x=-5$, then we have $LS=|2(-5)+3|=|-10+3|=|-7|=7$ and $RS=2-(-5)=2+5=7$.
In this case $LS=RS$, so $x=-5$ is a solution.
\end{solution}

We next look at absolute values and inequalities. \\

\begin{example}{Absolute Value Inequality}{AbsoluteValueInequality}
Solve $|x-5|<7$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
This simply means $-7<x-5<7$.
Adding $5$ to each gives $-2<x<12$.
Therefore the solution is the interval $(-2,12)$.
\end{solution}

In some questions you must be careful when multiplying by a negative number as in the next problem. \\

\begin{example}{Absolute Value Inequality}{AbsoluteValueInequality2}
Solve $|2-z|<7$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
This simply means $-7<2-z<7$.
Subtracting $2$ gives: $-9<-z<5$.
Now multiplying by $-1$ gives: $9>z>-5$. \ifont{Remember to reverse the inequality signs!}
We can rearrange this as $-5<z<9$.
Therefore the solution is the interval $(-5,9)$.
\end{solution}

\bigskip

\begin{example}{Absolute Value Inequality}{AbsoluteValueInequality3}
Solve $|2-z|\geq 7$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
Recall that for $a>0$, $|x|\geq a$ means $x\leq -a$ or $x\geq a$.
Thus, either $2-z\leq -7$ \ifont{or} $2-z\geq 7$.
Either $9\leq z$ \ifont{or} $-5 \geq z$.
Either $z\geq 9$ \ifont{or} $z \leq -5$.
In interval notation, either $z$ is in $[9,\infty)$ \ifont{or} $z$ is in $(-\infty,-5]$.
All together, we get our solution to be: $(-\infty,-5]\cup [9,\infty)$.
\end{solution}

In the previous two examples the \ifont{only} difference is that one had $<$ in 
the question and the other had $\geq$. Combining the two solutions gives the 
\ifont{entire} real number line! \\

\begin{example}{Absolute Value Inequality}{AbsoluteValueInequality4}
Solve $0<|x-5|\leq 7$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
We split this into two cases.

(1) For $0<|x-5|$ note that we always have that an absolute value is positive or zero (i.e., $0\leq |x-5|$ is always true).
So, for this part, we need to avoid $0=|x-5|$ from occurring. 
Thus, $x$ \ifont{cannot} be $5$, that is, $x\neq 5$.

(2) For $|x-5|\leq 7$, we have $-7\leq x-5\leq 7$.
Adding $5$ to each gives $-2\leq x\leq 12$.
Therefore the solution to $|x-5|\leq 7$ is the interval $[-2,12]$.

To combine (1) and (2) we need combine $x\neq 5$ with $x\in[-2,12]$.
Omitting $5$ from the interval $[-2,12]$ gives our solution to be: $[-2,5)\cup(5,12]$.
\end{solution}
