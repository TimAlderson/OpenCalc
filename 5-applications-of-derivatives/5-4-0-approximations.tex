\section{Linear and Higher Order Approximations}\label{sec:Approx}
When we define the derivative $f^{\prime
}\left( x\right) $ as the rate of change of $f\left( x\right) $ with respect
to $x,$ we notice that in relation to the graph of $f,$ the derivative is
the slope of the tangent line, which (loosely speaking) is the line that just
grazes the graph. But what precisely do we mean by this? In short,
\textbf{the tangent line approximates the graph near the point of contact}. The
definition of the derivative $f^{\prime }\left( a\right) $ guarantees this
when it exists: By taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ but not equal to $a,$%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{f\left( x\right) -f\left( a\right) }{x-a}\approx f^{\prime }\left(
a\right) ,
\end{equation*}%
and consequently,%
\begin{equation*}
f\left( x\right) \approx f^{\prime }\left( a\right) \left( x-a\right)
+f\left( a\right) .
\end{equation*}%
The left hand side gives us the $y$-value of the function $y=f\left(
x\right) $ and the right hand side gives us the $y$-value $y=f^{\prime
}\left( a\right) \left( x-a\right) +f\left( a\right) $ for the tangent line
to the graph of $f$ at the point $\left( a,f\left( a\right) \right) .$

In this section we will explore how to apply this idea to approximate some
values of $f$, some changes in the values of $f$, and also the roots of $f.$
