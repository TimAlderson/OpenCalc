\section{Optimization Problems}\label{sec:Optimization}

Many important applied problems involve finding the best way to
accomplish some task. Often this involves finding the maximum or
minimum value of some function: the minimum time to make a certain
journey, the minimum cost for doing a task, the maximum power that can
be generated by a device, and so on. Many of these problems can be
solved by finding the appropriate function and then using techniques
of calculus to find the maximum or the minimum value required.

Generally such a problem will have the following mathematical form:
Find the largest (or smallest) value of $f(x)$ when $a\le x\le
b$. Sometimes $a$ or $b$ are infinite, but frequently the real world
imposes some constraint on the values that $x$ may have.

Such a problem differs in two ways from the local maximum and minimum
problems we encountered when graphing functions: We are interested
only in the function between $a$ and $b$, and we want to know the
largest or smallest value that $f(x)$ takes on, not merely values that
are the largest or smallest in a small interval. That is, we seek not
a local maximum or minimum but a \ifont{global} (or \ifont{absolute})
maximum or minimum.
 
\begin{formulabox}[Guidelines to solving an optimization problem.]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Understand clearly what is to be maximized or minimized and what the contraints are.
	\item Draw a diagram (if appropriate) and label it.
	\item Decide what the variables are. For example, $A$ for area, $r$ for radius, $C$ for cost.
	\item Write a formula for the function for which you wish to find the maximum or minimum.
	\item Express that formula in terms of only one variable, that is, in the form $f(x)$. Usually this
				is accomplished by using the given constraints.
	\item Set $f'(x)=0$ and solve. Check all critical values and endpoints to determine the extreme value(s) of $f(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{formulabox}

\begin{example}{Largest Rectangle}{largestrectangle}
 Find the largest rectangle (that is, the rectangle with largest
area) that fits inside the graph of the parabola $\ds y=x^2$ below the
line $y=a$ ($a$ is an unspecified constant value), with the top side of
the rectangle on the horizontal line $y=a$; see
Figure~\ref{fig:rectangle optimization}.)
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
We want to find the maximum value of some function $A(x)$ representing
area.  Perhaps the hardest part of this problem is deciding what $x$
should represent. The lower right corner of the rectangle is at
$\ds (x,x^2)$, and once this is chosen the rectangle is completely
determined. So we can let the $x$ in $A(x)$ be the $x$ of the parabola
$\ds f(x)=x^2$.  Then the area is 
$$
	A(x)=(2x)(a-x^2)=-2x^3+2ax.
$$
We want
the maximum value of $A(x)$ when $x$ is in $\ds [0,\sqrt{a}]$. (You might
object to allowing $x=0$ or $\ds x=\sqrt{a}$, since then the ``rectangle''
has either no width or no height, so is not ``really'' a
rectangle. But the problem is somewhat easier if we simply allow such
rectangles, which have zero area.) 

Setting $\ds 0=A'(x)=6x^2+2a$ we get $\ds x=\sqrt{a/3}$ as the only critical
value. Testing this and the two endpoints, we have
$\ds A(0)=A(\sqrt{a})=0$ and $\ds A(\sqrt{a/3})=(4/9)\sqrt{3}a^{3/2}$. The
maximum area thus occurs when the rectangle has dimensions
$\ds 2\sqrt{a/3}\times (2/3)a$.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Largest Cone}{largestcone}
If you fit the largest possible cone inside a sphere, what fraction of the
volume of the sphere is occupied by the cone?  (Here by ``cone'' we mean a
right circular cone, i.e., a cone for which the base is perpendicular to
the axis of symmetry, and for which the cross-section cut perpendicular to
the axis of symmetry at any point is a circle.)
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
Let $R$ be the radius of the sphere, and let $r$ and $h$ be the base radius
and height of the cone inside the sphere.  What we want to maximize is the
volume of the cone: $\ds \pi r^2h/3$.  Here $R$ is a fixed value, but
$r$ and $h$ can vary.  Namely, we could choose $r$ to be as large as
possible---equal to $R$---by taking the height equal to $R$; or we
could make the cone's height $h$ larger at the expense of making $r$ a
little less than $R$.  See the cross-section depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:cone in sphere}. We
have situated the picture in a convenient way relative to the $x$ and
$y$ axes, namely, with the center of the sphere at the origin and the
vertex of the cone at the far left on the $x$-axis.

Notice that the function we want to maximize, $\ds \pi r^2h/3$,
depends on {\it two} variables.  This is frequently the case, but
often the two variables are related in some way so that ``really''
there is only one variable. So our next step is to
find the relationship and use it to solve for one of the variables in
terms of the other, so as to have a function of only one variable to
maximize.  In this problem, the condition is apparent in the figure:
the upper corner of the triangle, whose coordinates are $(h-R,r)$,
must be on the circle of radius $R$.  That is,
$$
	(h-R)^2+r^2=R^2.
$$ 
We can solve for $h$ in terms of $r$ or for $r$ in terms of $h$.
Either involves taking a square root, but we notice that the volume
function contains $\ds r^2$, not $r$ by itself, so it is easiest to solve
for $\ds r^2$ directly: $\ds r^2=R^2-(h-R)^2$.
Then we substitute the result into $\ds \pi r^2h/3$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(h)&=\pi(R^2-(h-R)^2)h/3\cr
&=-{\pi\over3}h^3+{2\over3}\pi h^2R\cr 
\end{eqnarray*} 
We want to maximize $V(h)$ when $h$ is between 0 and $2R$.  Now we
solve $\ds 0=f'(h)=-\pi h^2+(4/3)\pi h R$, getting $h=0$ or $h=4R/3$. 
We compute $V(0)=V(2R)=0$ and $\ds V(4R/3)=(32/81)\pi R^3$. The maximum is
the latter; since the volume of the sphere is $\ds (4/3)\pi R^3$, the
fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is 
$${(32/81)\pi R^3\over (4/3)\pi R^3}={8\over 27}\approx 30\%.$$
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Containers of Given Volume}{containersvolume}
You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume.  Suppose
that the top and bottom are made of a material that is $N$ times as
expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of
the cylinder.  

Find (in terms of $N$) the ratio of height to base radius of
the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making the containers.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
Let us first choose letters to represent various things: $h$ for the
height, $r$ for the base radius, $V$ for the volume of the
cylinder, and $c$ for the cost per unit area of the lateral side of
the cylinder; $V$ and $c$ are constants, $h$ and $r$ are variables.
Now we can write the cost of materials:
$$
  c(2\pi rh)+Nc(2\pi r^2).
$$
Again we have two variables; the relationship is provided by the fixed
volume of the cylinder: $\ds V=\pi r^2h$. We use this
relationship to eliminate $h$ (we could eliminate $r$, but it's a little easier
if we eliminate $h$, which appears in only one place in the above formula
for cost).  The result is
$$
   f(r)=2c\pi r{V\over\pi r^2}+2Nc\pi r^2={2cV\over r}+2Nc\pi r^2.
$$
We want to know the minimum value of this function when $r$ is in
$(0,\infty)$. 
We now set $\ds 0=f'(r)=-2cV/r^2+4Nc\pi
r$, giving $\ds r={\root 3 \of {V/(2N\pi)}}$.  
Since $\ds f''(r)=4cV/r^3+4Nc\pi$ is positive when $r$ is positive, there
is a local minimum at the critical value, and hence a global minimum
since there is only one critical value.

Finally, since $\ds h=V/(\pi r^2)$, 
$$
{h\over r}={V\over\pi r^3}={V\over \pi(V/(2N\pi))}=2N,
$$ 
so the minimum cost occurs when the height $h$ is $2N$ times the
radius. If, for example, there is no difference in the cost of
materials, the height is twice the radius (or the height is equal to
the diameter).
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Rectangles of Given Area}{rectanglesofgivenarea}
Of all rectangles of area 100, which has the smallest perimeter?
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
First we must translate this into a purely mathematical problem in
which we want to find the minimum value of a function.
If $x$ denotes one of the sides of the rectangle, then the adjacent side
must be $100/x$ (in order that the area be 100).  So the function we want
to minimize is 
$$
  f(x)=2x+2{100\over x}
$$
since the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width of the
rectangle. Not all values of $x$ make sense in this problem: lengths
of sides of rectangles must be positive, so $x>0$. If $x>0$ then so is
$100/x$, so we need no second condition on $x$.

We next find $f'(x)$ and set it equal to zero: $\ds 0=f'(x)=2-200/x^2$.
Solving $f'(x)=0$ for $x$ gives us $x=\pm 10$. We are interested only
in $x>0$, so only the value $x=10$ is of interest. Since $f'(x)$ is
defined everywhere on the interval $(0,\infty)$, there are no more
critical values, and there are no endpoints. Is there a local maximum,
minimum, or neither at $x=10$? The second derivative is
$\ds f''(x)=400/x^3$, and $f''(10)>0$, so there is a local minimum. Since
there is only one critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the
rectangle with smallest perimeter is the $10\times10$ square.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Maximize your Profit}{maximizeyourprofit}
You want to sell a certain number $n$ of items in order to maximize your
profit.  Market research tells you that if you set the price at \$1.50, you
will be able to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you lower the price
below \$1.50 you will be able to sell another 1000 items.  Suppose that
your fixed costs (``start-up costs'') total \$2000, and the per item cost
of production (``marginal cost'') is \$0.50.  

Find the price to set per
item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also
determine the maximum profit you can get.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
The first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization
problem. Since we want to maximize profit by setting the price per
item, we should look for a function $P(x)$ representing the profit
when the price per item is $x$. Profit is revenue minus costs, and
revenue is number of items sold times the price per item, so we get
$P=nx-2000-0.50n$. The number of items sold is itself a function of
$x$, $n=5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10$, because $ (1.5-x)/0.10$ is the number
of multiples of 10 cents that the price is below \$1.50.
Now we substitute for $n$ in the profit function:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  P(x)&=(5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10)x-2000- 0.5(5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10)\cr
&=-10000x^2+25000x-12000\cr
\end{eqnarray*} 
We want to know the maximum value of this function when $x$ is
between 0 and $1.5$. The derivative is $P'(x)=-20000x+25000$, which
is zero when $x=1.25$. Since $P''(x)=-20000<0$, there must be a local
maximum at $x=1.25$, and since this is the only critical value it must
be a global maximum as well. (Alternately, we could compute
$P(0)=-12000$, $P(1.25)=3625$, and $P(1.5)=3000$ and note that
$P(1.25)$ is the maximum of these.) Thus the maximum profit is \$3625,
attained when we set the price at \$1.25 and sell 7500 items.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Minimize Travel Time}{minimizetraveltime}
 Suppose you want to reach a point $A$ that is located across the
sand from a nearby road (see Figure~\ref{fig:minimize travel time}).
Suppose that the road is straight, and $b$ is the distance from $A$ to
the closest point $C$ on the road.  Let $v$ be your speed on the road,
and let $w$, which is less than $v$, be your speed on the sand.  Right
now you are at the point $D$, which is a distance $a$ from $C$.  At
what point $B$ should you turn off the road and head across the sand
in order to minimize your travel time to $A$?
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
Let $x$ be the distance short of $C$ where you turn off, i.e., the distance
from $B$ to $C$.  We want to minimize the total travel time.  Recall
that when traveling at constant velocity, time is distance divided by velocity.

You travel the distance
$\ds \overline{DB}$ at speed $v$, and then the distance $\ds \overline{BA}$ at
speed $w$.  Since $\ds \overline{DB}=a-x$ and, by the Pythagorean theorem,
$\ds \overline{BA}=\sqrt{x^2+b^2}$, the total time for the trip is 
$$
   f(x)={a-x\over v}+{\sqrt{x^2+b^2}\over w}.
$$
We want to find the minimum value of $f$ when $x$ is between 0 and $a$.
As usual we 
set $f'(x)=0$ and solve for $x$:
$$
\displaylines{
  0=f'(x)=-{1\over v}+{x\over w\sqrt{x^2+b^2}}\cr\\
  w\sqrt{x^2+b^2}=vx\cr\\
  w^2(x^2+b^2) = v^2x^2\cr\\
w^2b^2=(v^2-w^2)x^2\cr\\
x={wb\over\sqrt{v^2-w^2}}
}$$
Notice that $a$ does not appear in the last expression, but $a$ is not
irrelevant, since we are interested only in critical values that are
in $[0,a]$, and $\ds wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ is either in this interval or not.
If it is, we can use the second derivative to test it:
$$
f''(x) = {b^2\over (x^2+b^2)^{3/2}w}.
$$
Since this is always positive there is a local minimum at the critical
point, and so it is a global minimum as well.

If the critical value is not in $[0,a]$ it is larger than $a$. In this
case the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints. We can compute
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(0)&=\ds{a\over v}+{b\over w}\cr
\\
f(a)&=\ds{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\over w}\cr
\end{eqnarray*}
but it is difficult to determine which of these is smaller by direct
comparison. If, as is likely in practice, we know the values of $v$,
$w$, $a$, and $b$, then it is easy to determine this. With a little
cleverness, however, we can determine the minimum in general. We have seen that
$f''(x)$ is always positive, so the derivative $f'(x)$ is always increasing.
We know that at $\ds wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ the derivative is zero, so for
values of $x$ less than that critical value, the derivative is
negative. This means that $f(0)>f(a)$, so the minimum occurs when $x=a$.

So the upshot is this: If you start farther away from $C$ than
$\ds wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ then you always want to cut across the sand 
when you are a distance $\ds wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ from point $C$. If you
start closer than this to $C$, you should cut directly across the sand.
\end{solution}

%%You are standing near the side of a large wading pool of uniform depth when
%%you see a child in trouble.  You can run at a speed $\ds v_1$ on land and at a
%%slower speed $\ds v_2$ in the water.  Your perpendicular distance from the side
%%of the pool is $a$, the child's perpendicular distance is $b$, and the
%%distance along the side of the pool between the closest point to you and
%%the closest point to the child is $c$ (see the figure below). 
%%Without stopping to do any calculus, you instinctively choose the
%%quickest route (shown in the figure) and save the child.  Our
%%purpose is to derive a relation between the angle $\ds \theta_1$ your path
%%makes with the perpendicular to the side of the pool when you're on land,
%%and the angle $\ds \theta_2$ your path makes with the perpendicular when you're
%%in the water.  To do this, let $x$ be the distance between the closest
%%point to you at the side of the pool and the point where you enter the
%%water.  Write the total time you run (on land and in the water) in 
%%terms of $x$ (and also the constants $\ds a,b,c,v_1,v_2$).  Then set the
