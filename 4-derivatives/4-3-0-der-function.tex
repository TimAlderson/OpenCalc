\section{The Derivative Function}\label{sec:TheDerivativeFunction}
In Section \ref{sec:Slope}, we have seen how to create, or derive, a new function $f'(x)$ from a
function $f(x)$, and that this new function carries important
information. In one example we saw that $f'(x)$ tells us how steep the
graph of $f(x)$ is; in another we saw that $f'(x)$ tells us the velocity
of an object if $f(x)$ tells us the  position of the object at time
$x$. As we said earlier, this same mathematical idea is useful
whenever $f(x)$ represents some changing quantity and we want to know
something about how it changes, or roughly, the ``rate'' at which it
changes. Most functions encountered in practice are built up from a
small collection of ``primitive'' functions in a few simple ways, for
example, by adding or multiplying functions together to get new, more
complicated functions. To make good use of the information provided by
$f'(x)$ we need to be able to compute it for a variety of such functions.

We will begin to use different notations for the derivative of a
function. While initially confusing, each is often useful so it is
worth maintaining multiple versions of the same thing.

Consider again the function $\ds f(x)=\sqrt{625-x^2}$.
We have computed the derivative $\ds f'(x)=-x/\sqrt{625-x^2}$, and have
already noted that if we use the alternate notation
$\ds y=\sqrt{625-x^2}$ then we might write $\ds y'=-x/\sqrt{625-x^2}$.
Another notation is quite different, and in time it will become clear
why it is often a useful one. Recall that to compute the the
derivative of $f$ we computed 
$$
\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {\sqrt{625-(7+\Delta x)^2} - 24\over \Delta x}.
$$
The denominator here measures a distance in the $x$ direction,
sometimes called the ``run'', and the numerator measures a distance in
the $y$ direction, sometimes called the ``rise,'' and ``rise over
run'' is the slope of a line. Recall that sometimes such a numerator is
abbreviated $\Delta y$, exchanging brevity for a more detailed
expression. So in general, we define a derivative by the following equation.

\begin{definition}{Defnition of Derivative}{DerDefn}
The derivative of $y=f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is
$$y'=\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {\Delta y\over \Delta x}.$$
Some textbooks use $h$ in place of $\Delta x$ in the definition of
derivative: $$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ 
\end{definition}

To recall the form of the limit, we sometimes say instead that
$$
{dy\over dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {\Delta y\over \Delta x}.
$$ 
In other words, $dy/dx$ is another notation for the derivative, and
it reminds us that it is related to an actual slope between two
points. This notation is called \dfont{Leibniz notation}, 
after Gottfried Leibniz, who developed the fundamentals
of calculus independently, at about the same time that Isaac Newton
did.  Again, since we often use $f$ and $f(x)$ to mean the original
function, we sometimes use $df/dx$ and $df(x)/dx$ to refer to the
derivative. If the function $f(x)$ is written out in full we often
write the last of these something like this
$$f'(x)={d\over dx}\sqrt{625-x^2}$$
with the function written to the side, instead of trying to fit it into
the numerator.

\begin{example}{Derivative of $y=t^2$}{Derivative1}
Find the derivative of $\ds y=f(t)=t^2$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
We compute 
\[ \begin{array}{rll}
y' &=& \ds\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\ds\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}  \\
\\
	&=&\ds\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\ds\frac{(t+\Delta t)^2-t^2}{\Delta t} \\
	\\
&=&\ds\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\ds\frac{t^2+2t\Delta t+\Delta t^2-t^2}{\Delta t} \\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\ds\frac{2t\Delta t+\Delta t^2}{\Delta t} \\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{\Delta t\to0} 2t+\Delta t=2t. \\
\end{array}\]
\end{solution}

Remember that $\Delta t$ is a single quantity, not a ``$\Delta$''
times a ``$t$'', and so $\ds \Delta t^2$ is $\ds (\Delta t)^2$ not 
$\ds \Delta (t^2)$.
Doing the same example using the second formula for the derivative with $h$ in place of $\Delta t$ gives the following.
Note that we compute $f(t+h)$ by substituting $t+h$ in place of $t$ everywhere we see $t$ in the expression $f(t)$,
\textit{while making no other changes} (at least initially). For example, if $f(t)=t+\sqrt{(t+3)^2-t}$ then $f(t+h)=(t+h)+\sqrt{((t+h)+3)^2-(t+h)}=t+h+\sqrt{(t+h+3)^2-t-h}$.

\begin{example}{Derivative of $y=t^2$}{Derivative1b}
Find the derivative of $\ds y=f(t)=t^2$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
We compute 
\[ \begin{array}{rll}
f'(t) &=& \ds\lim_{h\to0}\ds\frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}  \\
\\
	&=&\ds\lim_{h\to0}\ds\frac{(t+h)^2-t^2}{h} \\
	\\
&=&\ds\lim_{h\to0}\ds\frac{t^2+2th+h^2-t^2}{h} \\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{h\to0}\ds\frac{2th+h^2}{h} \\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{h\to0} 2t+h=2t. \\
\end{array}\]
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{Derivative}{Derivative2}
Find the derivative of $y=f(x)=1/x$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
The computation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y' &=& \lim_{\Delta x\to0}{\Delta y\over\Delta x}\cr
\\
&=&\lim_{\Delta x\to0}{ {1\over x+\Delta x} - {1\over x}\over \Delta
  x}\cr
\\
&=&\lim_{\Delta x\to0}{ {x\over x(x+\Delta x)} - 
{x+\Delta x\over x(x+\Delta x)}\over \Delta x}\cr
\\
&=&\lim_{\Delta x\to0}{ {x-(x+\Delta x)\over x(x+\Delta x)}\over \Delta x}\cr
\\
&=&\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {x-x-\Delta x\over x(x+\Delta x)\Delta x}\cr
\\
&=&\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {-\Delta x\over x(x+\Delta x)\Delta x}\cr
\\
&=&\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {-1\over x(x+\Delta x)}={-1\over x^2}\cr
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{solution}

{\bf Note:}  If you happen to know some ``derivative formulas'' from
an earlier course, for the time being you should pretend that you do
not know them.
In examples like the ones above and the exercises below, you are required
to know how to find the derivative formula starting from basic principles.
We will later develop some formulas so that we do not always need to
do such computations, but we will continue to need to know how to do
the more involved computations.

To recap, given any function $f$ and any number $x$ in the domain of $f$, we define
$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ wherever this limit exists, and we call
the number $f'(x)$ the derivative of $f$ at $x$. Geometrically, $f'(x)$ is the slope of
the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at the point $(x,f(x))$.  The following
symbols also represent the derivative:
$$f'(x)=y'=\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{df}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}f(x).$$ The symbol
$d/dx$ is called a differential operator which means to take the
derivative of the function $f(x)$ with respect to the variable $x$.

In the next example we emphasize the geometrical interpretation of derivative.

\begin{example}{Geometrical Interpretation of Derivative}{GeometricalInterpretationDerivative}
Consider the function $f(x)$ given by the graph below.
Verify that the graph of $f'(x)$ is indeed the derivative of $f(x)$ by analyzing slopes of tangent lines to the graph at different points.
$$\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{images/deriv1}$$
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
We must think about the tangent lines to the graph of $f$, because the slopes
of these lines are the values of $f'(x)$.

We start by checking the graph of $f$ for horizontal tangent lines, since horizontal
lines have a slope of 0. We find that the tangent line is horizontal at the points
where $x$ has the values -1.9 and 1.8 (approximately). At each of these values of $x$,
we must have $f'(x)=0$, which means that the graph of $f'$ has an $x$-intercept (a point
where the graph intersects the $x$-axis). 

Note that horizontal tangent lines have a slope of zero and these
occur approximately at the points $(-1.9,-3.2)$ and $(1.8,3.2)$ of the
graph.  Therefore $f'(x)$ will cross the $x$-axis when $x=-1.9$ and
$x=1.8$.  

Analyzing the slope of the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x=0$ gives
approximately $3.0$, thus, $f'(0)=3.0$.  Similarly, analyzing the
slope of the tangent lines of $f(x)$ at $x=1$ and $x=-1$ give
approximately $2.0$ for both, thus, $f'(1)=f'(-1)=2.0$.
\end{solution}

In the next example we verify that the slope of a straight line is $m$.

\begin{example}{Derivative of a Linear Function}{DerivativeLinearFunction}
Let $m,b$ be any two real numbers.
Determine $f'(x)$ if $f(x)=mx+b$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
By the definition of derivative (using $h$ in place of $\Delta x$) we have,
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(m(x+h)+b)-(mx+b)}{h}$$
$$=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{mh}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}m=m.$$

This is not surprising. We know that $f'(x)$ always represents the slope of a tangent
line to the graph of $f$. In this example, since the graph of $f$ is a straight line $y=mx+b$
already, every tangent line is the same line $y=mx+b$. Since this line has a slope of $m$,
we must have $f'(x)=m$.
\end{solution}
