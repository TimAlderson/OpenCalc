\subsection{Second and Other Derivatives}
If $f$ is a differentiable function then its derivative $f'$ is also a function and so we can take the derivative of $f'$.
The new function, denoted by $f''$, is called the \dfont{second derivative} of $f$, since it is the derivative of the derivative of $f$.

The following symbols represent the second derivative:
$$f''(x)=y''=\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right).$$

We can continue this process to get the third derivative of $f$.

In general, the \dfont{$n$th derivative} of $f$ is denoted by $f^{(n)}$ and is obtained from $f$ by differentiating $n$ times.
If $y=f(x)$, then we write:
$$y^{(n)}=f^{(n)}(x)=\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}.$$
